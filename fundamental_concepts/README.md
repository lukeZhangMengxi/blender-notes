# Fundamental Concepts
## Mesh modeling
- Mesh: a collection of faces, edges and vertices that make up a 3D shape.
- A different modeling would be sculpting.
- Loop: a set of adjacent shapes of the same kind (could be edge loop or face loop and so on)
- Normals: perpendicular intersections with a plane or face
